<p>The comparative study of games is one that promises an important
contribution to the history of culture. The questions involved in their
diffusion over the earth are among the vital ones that confound the
ethnologist. Their origins are lost in the unwritten history of the childhood
of man. Mancala is a game that is remarkable for its peculiar
distribution, which seems to mark the limits of Arab culture, and which
has just penetrated our own continent after having served for ages to
divert the inhabitants of nearly half the inhabited area of the globe.</p>

<p>The visitor to the little Syrian colony in Washington street in New
York City will often find two men intent upon this game. They call
it Mancala. The implements are a board with two rows of cup-shaped
depressions and a handful or so of pebbles or shells, which they transfer
from one hole to another with much rapidity. A lad from Damascus
described to me
the methods
of play. There
are two principal
ways, which
depend upon
the manner in
which the pieces
are distributed
at the commencement of the game. Two persons always engage, and
ninety-eight cowrie shells (wada) or pebbles (hajdar) are used. One
game is called La’b madjnuni, or the “Crazy game.” The players seat
themselves with the board placed lengthwise between them. One distributes
the pieces in the fourteen holes, called bute, “houses,” not less
than two being placed in one hole. This player then takes all the
pieces from the hole at the right of his row, <a href="#fig-1">fig. 1</a>, <span class="allsmcap">G</span>, called el ras, “the
head,” and drops them one at a time into the holes on the opposite side,
commencing with <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and so on. If any remain after he has put
one in each of the holes on the opposite side, he continues around on
his own row <span class="allsmcap">A</span>, <span class="allsmcap">B</span>, <span class="allsmcap">C</span>. When he has dropped his last piece he takes all
the pieces in that hole and continues dropping them around as before.
This is done until one of two things happens&mdash;his last piece drops
into an empty hole, when he stops and his opponent plays, or it drops
into a hole containing one or three pieces, completing two or four. In
that case he takes the two or four pieces with those in the hole opposite,
and if one or more of the holes that follow contains two or four without
the intervention of a
hole with any other number,
he takes their contents
with those opposite.
The second player takes
from the hole <i>g</i>, and distributes
his pieces around
<span class="allsmcap">A</span>, <span class="allsmcap">B</span>, <span class="allsmcap">C</span>. If the head is
empty, the player takes
from the next nearest hole
in his row. When the
board is cleared, each player counts the number he has above his opponent
as his gains. No skill is necessary or of any avail in this game,
the result being a mathematical certainty, according to the manner in
which the pieces were distributed in the beginning. La’b hakimi, the
“Rational game,” or La’b akila, the “Intelligent game,” is so called in
contrast to the preceding. Success in it depends largely upon the skill
of the players. In this game it is customary in Syria to put seven
pieces in each hole. The players, instead of first taking from the hole
on their right, may select any hole on their side of the board as a starting
place. They calculate the hole in which the last piece will fall, and
the result depends largely upon this calculation. La’b rosëya is a variety
of the first game and is played only by children. Seven cowries
are placed in each hole, and the first player invariably wins. My
Syrian friend told me that the shells used in the game are brought
from the shores of the Red Sea. Mancala is a common game in Syrian
cafés. Children frequently play the game in holes made in the ground
when they have no board, a device also resorted to by travelers who
meet by the way.</p>

<p>Mancala, the name which the Syrians give to this game, is a common
Arabic word and means in this connection the “Game of transferring.”
It is not mentioned in the Koran by this name, but must have been
known to the Arabs in the Middle Ages, as it is referred to in the commentary
to the Kitab al Aghani, the “Book of Songs,” which speaks
of a “game like Mancala.”</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Hyde gave a very good account of it two hundred years
ago in his treatise, “De Ludis Orientalibus” (see <a href="#fig-3">fig. 3</a>), and Lane, in his
“Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians,” describes it very fully
as played in Cairo upon a board with twelve holes, quite in the manner
I have related. Seventy-two shells or pebbles are there used, and,
whether shells or pebbles, are indifferently called hasa. The hemispherical
holes in the board are called buyoot, plural of beyt. The
score of the game is sixty, and when the successive gains of a player
amount to that sum he has won. I soon found that I had learned from
my Syrian acquaintance nothing that had not been recorded, but upon
visiting the Damascus House in the Turkish village at the Columbian
Exposition at Chicago, I was enabled to engage with the Syrians in
the game, and was impressed with the peculiar distribution of the game
over the world. The Ceylon exhibit contained boards from the Maldives
with sixteen holes in two parallel rows, with a large hole at either
end. (Figs. <a href="#fig-5">4</a> and
<a href="#fig-5">5</a>.) Here the game
is called Naranj.
Boards in the same
exhibit from Ceylon
had fourteen holes
with two large central
cavities (<a href="#fig-6">fig. 6</a>),
the game being
called Chanka. An
Indian gentleman informed me that the game was common at Bombay.
His Highness the Sultan of Johore exhibited a boat-shaped board with
sixteen holes (<a href="#fig-7">fig. 7</a>) under the name of Chongkak. I learned, too, that
the game was common in Java, as well as in the Philippine Islands,
where a boat-shaped board with sixteen holes is also used (<a href="#plate-2-fig-2">pl. 2, fig. 2</a>),
the game being called Chungcajon. It would thus appear that the game
extends along the entire coast of Asia as far as the Philippine Islands.
Mancala and a kind of draughts were the favorite amusements of the
negroes from the French settlement of Benin on the west coast of
Africa in the so-called Dahomey village at the Columbian Fair. They
played on a boat-shaped board, with twelve holes in two rows, which
they called adjito, with pebbles, adji, the game itself being called Madji.
It is with the continent of Africa that the game of Mancala seems
most closely identified. It may be regarded, so to speak, as the African
national game. In the exhibit of the State of Liberia at Chicago,
there were no less than eleven boards, comprising three different forms,
said to be from the Deys, Veys, Pesseh, Gedibo, and Queah. (Figs. <a href="#fig-8">8</a>,
<a href="#fig-9">9</a>, and <a href="#fig-10">10</a>.) They were catalogued under the name of Poo, by which
name the game is known to civilized Liberians. The game is, in fact,
distributed among the African tribes from the east to the west and
from the north to the south. In Nubia, where a board with sixteen
holes is used, it is known as Mungala.</p>

  </p></div>
</div>

<p>In the narrative of the Portuguese embassy of Alvarez to Abyssinia
(1520-1527) reference is made to “Mancal” as an unknown game, antiquated
in the reign of Don Manuel. Bent has recently described it as
still existing in Abyssinia under the name of Gabattà.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (<a href="#fig-11">Fig. 11</a>.) Dr.
George Schweinfurth states that it is played by the Niam-Niam, and
is constantly played by all the people of the entire Gazelle district,
although perhaps not known to the Moubuttoo. The Niam-Niam call the
board, which has sixteen cavities, with two at the end for the reception
of the cowrie shells, Abangah, (<a href="#fig-12">fig. 12</a>) and the Bongo name for the board
is Toee. He also says that it is found among the Peulhs, the Foolahs,
the Toloofs, and the Mandingos in the Senegal countries, who devote a
great portion of their time to this amusement. Rohlfs found it among
the Kadje, between the Tsad and the Benue.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It also occurs among the
Biafren and the Kimbunda. Héli Chatelain, who lived for some time at
Angola, described the game to me under the name Mbau, and said that
cavities are cut in the rock for this game at the stations where the
porters halt. A board collected by him at Elmina, now in the U. S.
National Museum, Washington, D. C., has twelve holes in two rows,
with large holes at the ends. (<a href="#plate-3">Pl. 3.</a>)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Speaking of the peasants of Sallaba, he says: “These primitive people are perfect
artists in cow dung. With this material they make big jars in which to keep
their grain, drinking goblets, and boards for the universal game, which the better
class make of wood. I brought one of these away with me to show how universal
this game is among the Abyssinians, from the chief to the peasant, and it reached
the British Museum unbroken. This game is called Gabattà, and the wooden boards
made by the better class contain eighteen holes, nine for each person. There are
three balls, called chachtma, for each hole, and the game is played by a series of
passing, which seemed to us very intricate, and which we could not learn; the holes
they call their toukouls, or huts, and they get very excited over it. It closely resembles
the game we saw played by the negroes in Mashonaland, and is generally found
in one form or another in the countries where Arab influence has at one time or
another been felt.” (“The Sacred City of the Ethiopians,” London, 1873, pp. 72-73.)</p>

<p>Among the Fans of the Gaboon River the game is called Kale,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>

Another board in the U. S. National Museum, collected by that adventurous
traveler, Dr. W. L. Abbott, from the Wa Chaga tribe at Mount
Kilima-njaro, has twenty-six holes arranged in four rows of six each,
with two large holes at the ends. (<a href="#plate-4-fig-2">Pl. 4, fig. 2.</a>) He describes it in his
catalogue, published by the Smithsonian Institution, under the name
of Óchi, used for playing Bau, a common game throughout Africa, and
says that it is played with nicker seeds and pebbles. Bent, in his
“Ruined Cities of Mashonaland,” gives the following account of the
game: “Huge trees sheltered the entrance to their village, beneath
which men were playing Isafuba, the mysterious game of the Makalangas,
with sixty holes, in rows, in the ground. Ten men can play at
this game, and it consists of removing bits of pottery or stone from one
hole to another in an unaccountable manner. We watched it scores of
times while in the country, and always gave it up as a bad job, deciding
that it must be like draughts or chess learned by them from the former
civilized race who dwelt here.” He then proceeds to identify Isafuba
with the games of Wari played on the west coast of Africa.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a>
The collector, Rev. A. C. Good, gives the following account of the game: “Two
players seat themselves on opposite sides of the board, and four counters are placed
in each of the twelve pockets. Then one player takes the counters out of a pocket
on his own side and drops one in each pocket around as far as they will go, going to
right and back on his opponents side in the opposite direction from that in which
the hands of the clock move. They move thus alternately until one manages to
make his last counter fall in a pocket on his opponent’s side, where there were only
one or two counters. When he has done so he has won the counters in that pocket,
including his own last counter. These he transfers to the receptacle in the end of
the board to his right. A single counter taken from last pocket on player’s right
can not win from opponent’s first pocket opposite, even though it contains only one
or two counters. When a pocket has accumulated twelve or more counters, so that
a player drops clear around and back to where he began, he must skip the pocket
from which he started. When so few counters remain in the pocket on the board
that no more can be won, the game is ended and each counts his winnings. The
counters that remain in the board at the end of the game are not counted by either
player. The game is sometimes varied thus: When a counter wins as above, not
only the contents of that pocket is won, but of the pocket or pockets before it on
the opponent’s side that has contained only one or two counters back until one is
reached that has been empty or had three or more counters before the play. This
last is rather the better game of the two. The Fans do not play these games skillfully.
They seem unable to count ahead to see where the last count will fall. A
white man, as soon as he understands the game, will beat them every time.”</p>

  Gaboon River, Africa.<br />
  <small>From a specimen in the Museum of Archæology and Palæontology, University of Pennsylvania.</small>
  </p></div>
</div>

<p>Prince Momolu Massaquoi, son of the King of the Vei tribe, described
to me the manner of playing the game among the Vei. They call the
game Kpo, a word having an explosive sound resembling a note of the
xylophone, mimicking the noise made by the seeds or ivory balls with
which the game is played when tossed into the holes on the board. The
boards, which are made with twelve holes in two rows, with large holes
at the ends, are called by the same name. The boards used by the
chiefs are often very expensive, being made of ivory and ornamented
with gold. He had seen boards which cost 20 slaves. The holes in
the boards are called kpo sing or kpo kungo, kungo meaning “cup.”
The game is usually played with sea beans, which grow on vines like
the potato on the west coast, or by the chiefs with the before-mentioned
ivory balls. These seeds are called kpo kunje, kunje meaning
“seed.” He identified a board from the Gaboon River as suitable for
the game, although he said that much more elaborate ones, like those
in the Liberian exhibit, were common. The depression in the middle
of the board from the Gaboon River is intended to catch pieces that
do not fall in the hole for which they are intended. Cheating is practiced,
and to guard against it players must raise their arms and throw
the pieces upon the board with some violence. Two, three, or four
play. The game differs somewhat from that played in Syria and
Egypt. A player may commence at any hole on his side. His play
ends when the pieces first taken up are played. He wins when the
number in the last hole is increased to two or to three. He does not
take those in the hole opposite. When two play, four beans are put in
each hole, but when three or four play three beans are put in each
hole. When two play, the pieces are dropped around in the same direction
as in the Syrian game, but when three or four play they may
be dropped in either direction. When two play, each player takes one
side of the board; when three play, each takes four holes, two on each
side, dividing the board transversely into three parts, and when four
play, each takes three holes. When two play, a winner takes only
what he “kills” (fá); but when three or four play, when one completes
two or three in a hole by his play, he takes those in the next hole forward.
When a man takes a piece with one next to it, he uses his
fingers to squeeze the pieces into his hand, the operation being called
“squeezing” (boti), but this can only be done when one of the pieces is
in one of the player’s own cups and the other one or two in that of an
opponent. Players sit crosslegged upon the ground, and when the
chiefs play large numbers often assemble to watch them. I have given
Prince Momolu’s account somewhat at length, as several African travelers
have declared the game incomprehensible to a white man.</p>

<p>Dr. Schweinfurth regards the Mohammedan Nubians as having received
Mancala from their original home in Central Africa, and says
that the recurrence of an object even trivial as this is an evidence, in
a degree indirect and collateral, of the essential unity that underlies all
African nations. Mr. Bent justly says that the game is found in some
form or another wherever Arabian influence is felt, but, continuing,
states that it forms for us another link in the chain of evidence connecting
the Mashonaland ruins with an Arabian influence. Dr. Richard
Andree, in his well-known work on Ethnological Parallels,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in
which he has brought together many accounts of the game, says that
he regards its progress from west to east, from Asia to the coast of the
Atlantic. This opinion I share. Peterman relates that Mancala is
played in Damascus with pebbles which pilgrims collect in a certain
valley on their way from Mecca. From the comparatively early mention
of the game in Arabic literature, and the retention of its Arabic name
in Africa, Arabia would appear to be the source from which it was
disseminated. Mohammed proscribed the Meiser game; and games of
hazard, although played, are regarded by Mohammedans as prohibited
by their religion. Mancala, a game of fate or calculation, appears to
be looked upon with toleration, and it is not unreasonable to suppose
that its wide diffusion is due to its having been carried by returning
pilgrims to the various parts of the Mohammedan world. If we accept
this theory of its distribution, we have yet the more difficult question
of its origin. This, I fear, is not to be determined directly, and will
only be surely known when we attain a greater knowledge of the rules
or laws which underlie the development of games, even as they do
every other phase of the development of human culture.</p>

  Island of St. Lucia.<br />
  Collected by Rev. F. Gardiner, Cat. No. 151286, U. S. N. M.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I have recently been informed that Mancala is a common amusement
of the negroes of San Domingo, who play upon boards scooped with
holes. A board in the U. S. National Museum (<a href="#plate-5">pl. 5</a>) was collected by
the Rev. F. Gardiner, jr., in St. Lucia, where the game is played by the
negroes under the name of Wa-wee.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a>
Mr. Gardiner writes in a letter to Dr. G. Brown Goode under date of May 2, 1895:
“The game of Wa-wee was bought in St. Lucia, but I found it in use also in Barbados
and Martinique among the negroes. As far as I could ascertain, they supposed
it very old&mdash;came from their fathers. I supposed it came from Africa; but no one
seemed to know anything about it. It is a regular gambling game.” In regard to
the method of play, he says: “As near as I can remember, each of the small side
holes has a given number of beans put in, each man taking one side and one large
hole as a goal. The beans are taken up from one hole in the hand and dropped in a
certain order in the other holes, going round the whole circle. If the last one drops
in a hole which has a certain number of beans in it (I don’t remember the number),
he picks that lot up and goes on. The object is to land the most beans of your own
and taken from your adversary in the end holes.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is not unlikely that Mancala may some day take its place among
our own fireside amusements, when this account may answer some
inquiries that may be made as to its history.</p>

<p>Since the above was written I have learned that the game of Mancala
was published in the United States in 1891, under the name of Chuba,
by the Milton Bradley Company, of Springfield, Mass., who furnish the
following rules and account of the game:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chuba is an adaptation from a rude game of eastern Africa which is greatly enjoyed
by the natives, who squat on the ground and play in holes scooped out of the sand,
using shells, young cocoanuts, etc., for counters, which they move from hole to hole.
As now presented to the civilized world for its diversion, Chuba is a game of skill
for two players. It is made up of a board with 4 parallel rows of holes or pockets,
11 in each row, and 60 small beads used as men or counters. [See <a href="#fig-14">fig. 14</a>.].</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig-14" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig-14.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">
  <p>Fig. 14.<br />
  <span class="allsmcap">CHUBA.</span><br />
  <small>Position of men at opening of the game.</small>
  </p></div>
</div>

<p>The board is placed between the players as usual, with the longer sides next to
them. Each one confines his playing to the two rows of pockets nearest him. The
row close to his edge of the board is his outer row, while the other is his inner row.</p>

<p>Before beginning the game each player places a single counter in each of the
pockets of his outer row and two counters in each pocket of his inner row, except
that the pocket on his extreme left in the inner row is kept vacant and the one next
to it holds but one man. The above diagram shows the arrangement of the board
at the opening of the game. As indicated by the arrows, all moves in the inner row
are from right to left, and those in the outer row from left to right. As the players
face each other the moves in the two inner rows are necessarily in opposite directions.</p>

<p>The privilege of playing first in the first game is left to agreement or chance, not
being regarded as of any consequence. In subsequent games the player who was
victor in the last contest takes the lead.</p>

<p>The first player chooses any pocket in his inner row which contains more than one
man from which to start his first move, and begins the game by picking up all the
men in that pocket and dropping one of them in each of the consecutive pockets to
his left until all the men in his hand have been distributed. If the last counter
drops into a pocket that is occupied, the player continues the move by picking up
all the men in that pocket, including the one dropped, and disposing of them as
before. His move must continue in this same way until the last counter in his hand
falls into an empty pocket, and the move may extend around the course, into the
outer row, or even farther, as indicated by the arrows.</p>

<p>If this empty pocket into which the last man falls is in the inner row and has
opposite it a pocket in the opponent’s inner row containing one or more men, the
player captures these men and at once removes them from the board. And if there
are one or more men in the corresponding opposite pocket of the opponent’s outer
row, they must also be taken. Furthermore, he must select another pair of opposite
pockets in his opponent’s rows from which to remove any men that they contain. In
making this choice he is at liberty to pick out any pair of opposites, whether both
are occupied or empty, or one is occupied and the other empty. The accompanying
diagram will explain the meaning of this rule. [See <a href="#fig-15">fig. 15</a>.]</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig-15" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig-15.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">
  <p>Fig. 15.<br />
  <span class="allsmcap">CHUBA.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Suppose the player B had just finished a move by dropping a “last man” in No. 1.
He can capture all the men in 2 and 3 by his skill and also in 4 and 5 or from any
other two opposite pockets of his opponent’s inner and outer rows. Had 2 been
vacant, however, he could not have taken any men. Had 3 been vacant, he could
have taken the men from 2 and those from 4 and 5. Had his last man fallen in the
outer row, in 6 for example, the effect would have been of no avail in capturing anything,
because the outer row is always noncombatant.</p>

<p>A man in the outer row can not be moved until he has been played upon by a man
from the inner row.</p>

<p>A move can not begin from a pocket holding a single man if the player has a
pocket containing more than one man. When a move does begin from a pocket containing
a single man, it can not be played into an occupied pocket.</p>

<p>When all the men which a player has become single, those remaining in his outer
row which have not been played on are forfeited to the opponent.</p>

<p>The winner is the player who captures all his opponent’s men.</p>

<p>It is an advantage to a player to get his counters singled as soon as possible, unless
he sees that his opponent is doing the same thing, when a different policy is wise.</p>

<p>If he wishes to cover two or three vacant spaces in order to effect a capture, it can
often be done, provided he begins his move far enough back from those vacant
pockets.</p>

<p>The loss of counters during the earlier part of the game is not necessarily as great
a disadvantage as in most games, because so much depends on the final move, in
which there is the chance for a brilliant display of skill.</p>

<p>The native players of the original Chuba say “chee” at the end of each move,
which gives notice to the opponent to proceed; and toward the close of the game,
when the moves follow in rapid succession, the effect is very amusing.</p>

<p>The natives call the counters in the inner row “man and wife,” and those in the
outer row “spinsters.” But these spinsters are married by passing a counter over
them from the inner row, till, in the progress of the game, all the pieces become
single, when they are all called “widows.” These widows have a double advantage
over the married families, and are sure to make havoc among them. The game is
appropriately named, as the word chuba means “to extinguish” or “eat up,” and
the object of each player is to annihilate his opponent by putting the latter’s
counters in a position from which escape is impossible.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
